# React + Vite

This SPA created in React Js with vite, consists of searching for images and a brief description taking the Unplash API as a reference.

It is 100% responsive and when you click on one of the images or title, it redirects you to the main place where the image belongs.

Dependencies such as Formik were used to control the forms and SweetAlert to use modals.

To build it locally install the following dependencies:
1 - yarn install (To install the nodule_modules)
2 - npm install sweetalert2
3 - npm i formik

Once the necessary dependencies are installed, build the project using "yarn dev".
